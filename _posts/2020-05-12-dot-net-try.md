Recently I came accross a new C#/dotnet editor to code interactively in browser window. Through this online code editor we can create POC or practice c#. Users can run/edit code online in their browser without installing .net on their machine.

This is an open source tool, supported by Microsoft. Micosoft uses this tool on their documentation portal.
